This is a budget tracker that will calculate your income and expenses. If you do not have a date, description, and amount entered, there will be an error message. Amount entered cannot be a negative number or you will receive an error message. Your entry will populate onto the income or expenses container. If your total balance is positive, the number will be green. If your total balance becomes negative, the number will turn red.
